## Southern New Hampshire University Data Analytics ePortfolio

## Capstone
My name is Keone, best pronounced as (Ke Own E). I maintained the Honors President's List at Southern New Hampshire University of a 3.78 GPA or higher. I am a first-generation dual major, studying computer science and data analytics. Both of which have concentrations in software engineering and project management. The projects associated with this page are part of the Data Analytics program from Southern New Hampshire University. The ePortfolio contains a narrated review of artifacts developed previously in my years at SNHU and have been further developed to showcase my abilities.
