## Data Analytics BSDA
My name is Keone, best pronounced as (Ke Own E). I am a first-generation double major studying BSCS and BSDA, with concentrations in software engineering and project management. I am an (x6) Presidents List Honors at Southern New Hampshire University and am devoted to achieving a career as an IT and Data professional. I am seeking job opportunities as a Data Scientist, as this title performs in the skills and knowledge from both degrees. I am on track to complete my education in 2022 and have achieved the Executive Leadership Certification from the National Society of Leadership and Success. Allowing me to understand the foundations of leadership while examining different perspectives that demonstrate success in networking strategies applied to projects and in management. My mission is that of the NSLS, to help develop future leaders who achieve skill, exemplify, and influence positive and impactful leadership while enriching and enabling others to succeed.

## 1. Professional Self-Assessment
I have been in the computer science program since January of 2018, putting me at 4 years to complete my degree. While in the program, I have learned that there are many applications for hardware and software to co-exist. When building a computer to meet the needs of a client; cost, performance, and limitations are considered to provide the best possible outcome. When developing code, security policies are used to ensure that code written relinquishes bugs, vulnerabilities, and data loss. Within the computer science program, having the ability to work with diverse programming languages along with comments in code are good practice, and provides avenues to reverse engineer software. In addition to achieveing my BSCS, I have also attained a second degree in data anaytics with a concentration in project management. I have learned to utalize the knowledge and skill obtained from both degrees and apply them as a data profressional in data governance, data quality, data tranformation, data integrety, data integration, hypothesis testing and visial reporting. As a first-generation dual major working towards a BSCS and BSDA, I aim to work as a data professional as a scientist/engineer.
